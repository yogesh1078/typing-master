The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
A stitch in time saves nine.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Better late than never, but never late is better.
Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
The early bird catches the worm.
Practice makes perfect.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Blood is thicker than water.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
A watched pot never boils.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
All that glitters is not gold.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Better safe than sorry.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Fortune favors the bold.
Haste makes waste.
Honesty is the best policy.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Ignorance is bliss.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Look before you leap.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No pain, no gain.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Old habits die hard.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Patience is a virtue.
Practice what you preach.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Silence is golden.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Strike while the iron is hot.
